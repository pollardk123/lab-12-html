intro paragraph :
My name is Kaitlyn Pollard, currently pursing a bachelors degree in Emerging Media with an Associates in Sound Recording Technology. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, enjoy animals, food, traveling , and trying new places. I plan on taking my career in the direction of music where I first had an appreciation for it growing up.
From the age of 8 I would participate in school musicals vocally , up until middle school where I started playing instruments. It was in high school I realized I did not want to be a performer, but more of a behind the scenes person still in the music industry .
My dad was the person who suggested sound engineer , I researched the job description and it was a match made . I knew I wanted to be in the music field but helping others bring their vision to light while being hands on with an important role. Little did I know what that2 role was called. 
I plan to take my bachelors from City Tech to get a job in the sound field, working on sound design for movies, shows, recording studios, audio for video games, and wherever else a sound engineer is needed.
